Hi everyone. Today we will practice the three coding questions from our midterm. 
Before that, I would like to say something about our grading policy. If you have any questions about your grades, feel free to contact Dr. Cao and me before next Wednesday.

For the first, each subquestion counts 0.5 points.

For the second question, no square bracket should appear in your code. That counts 1 point. Correctly writing for and if each counts 1 point. If you have any other typo, it will cost you 0.5 point.

For the third one, each subquestion counts 0.5 point.

For the fourth one, correctly writing for and if, each counts 1 point. Turning uppercase to lower case counts 1 point. Any typo costs you 0.5 point.

For the fifth question, declaring d as 0 and d = d+new result, that part counts 1 point. Using * for multiplication counts 1 point. For counts 1 point. Any typo costs you 0.5 point.

For question 6 and 7, each counts 0.5 point.
